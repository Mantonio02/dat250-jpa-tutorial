# DAT250 Expass 4

## Technical Issues:
- Did not encounter any issues with installation.
- Had issue with running Main after gradle run, was due to outdated Java JDK version. Fixed by changing to newer JDK.
- Encountered challenges with JPA testing such as to identical objects being differentiated by different classes that caused an AssertionFailedError.
- (expected: org.hibernate.collection.spi.PersistentBag... but was: java.util.ImmutableCollections$...)
